## FYI

Make sure `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL` is set to `waffle` in your bashrc file
```sh
TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
```
and 
```sh
GZ_VERSION=HARMONIC
```

## Control Methodology

The state (linear and angular velocities) of the TurtleBot3 is modified over the internet via the MQTT protocol from a custom webpage (remote messages), which is developed using HTML and JavaScript for simplicity.

- A ros2 node is created to unpack the remote messages from the custom webpage and publish them to `/Twist` topic to modify the turtlebot3's state.
  
## MQTT Velocity Publisher

- The HTML page enables users to input `(x) linear velocity` and `(y) angular velocity` values and publish them as a JSON message to the MQTT topic `robot/cmd_vel`.  
- It utilizes the `mqtt.js` library to connect to the MQTT broker at `wss://broker.emqx.io:8084/mqtt`.  
- The connection status and any errors are logged to the browser console for monitoring.
